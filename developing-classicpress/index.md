# Developing ClassicPress

ClassicPress is developed on GitHub and we welcome bug reports, new pull requests and other contributions. Please take a look through our [open issues list](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/issues), or join [our Slack group](https://www.classicpress.net/join-slack/)" and ask in the **#core** channel if you have any questions.

Major changes must go through our [democratic process](https://www.classicpress.net/democracy/), starting with a petition.  Please see our [petitions site](https://petitions.classicpress.net/) for more information. We've made it easy to find existing feature requests and add your own.
