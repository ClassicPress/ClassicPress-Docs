# ClassicPress User Documentation: Custom Login Image

The custom logo image setting allows you to specify a custom image on the login screen to replace the default Classipress logo.

The default setting is to continue using the ClassicPress logo as before.

If you want to use a custom image there are two possible ways for it to be displayed - as a logo or as a banner. Select the image to be used as your custom logo or banner by clicking the "Choose image" button. You can use an existing image from the media library or upload a new file.

"Use my custom logo as an image" puts your logo in place of the ClassicPress logo. Your image will be displayed at a maximuum height and width of 100px, so this is the best option for square or portrait-style images.

"Use my custom logo as a banner" can be used for custom images that are wider or landscape-style. The image will be displayed at a maximum width of 320px and a maximum height of 240px.

HINT: If you want to display a larger version of your logo image, select the banner option. This will allow it to be displayed to a maximum height of 240px.

Make sure to save the page once you have chosen your image and set your preferred display option. To remove the image use the "Clear Image" button and save the page.
