# ClassicPress User Documentation: Custom Login Image

The custom logo image setting allows you to specify a custom image on the login screen to replace the default Classipress logo.

Select an image from the media libary to be used as your custom image. There are two options available - the image can either be displayed as a banner (full width of the login box) or a logo (a smaller square image centred above the login).

Make sure to save the page once you have chosen your image and set the preferred display option. To remove the image use the "Clear Image" button and save the page.
