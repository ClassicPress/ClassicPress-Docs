## Moving existing sites to Softaculous


![Installing ClassicPress using Softaculous](https://www.classicpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/softaculous-classicpress.jpg)

If you currently have an existing site and want to move it into Softaculous, here is how you do it.

You may want to do this under the following circumstances:

*   You have an existing site that was originally installed as a WordPress site by Softaculous, but you’ve migrated this site to ClassicPress.
*   You have an existing ClassicPress site and you’d like to manage its updates using Softaculous.

### Step 1: Disconnect your current install

If you have a site installed in Softaculous as a WordPress site, you will first need to remove it from the existing management system so that Softaculous doesn’t detect your ClassicPress site incorrectly and prompt you to “upgrade WordPress”.

**If your site was not installed by Softaculous as a WordPress site, then you can skip this step.**

Reach the “All Installs” button located top right and click it.

Next, select the install you need to disconnect and click the red X

Now uncheck all the boxes as per the screenshot below, this will disconnect the install from Softaculous without touching the files and database.

![Uncheck all the boxes](https://www.classicpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/step-1-2-soft.jpg)

After this, click on Remove Install at the bottom of the page as shown here:

![Remove Install](https://www.classicpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/step-1-3-soft.jpg)

You will be warned that the operation can’t be reverted, click ok.

### Step 2: Importing into Softaculous

Now, all you have to do is import the site in Softaculous linking it to ClassicPress, so that it can be managed via Softaculous.

Search for ClassicPress (in the Portals/CMS category) and select the ClassicPress page within the installer.

Click import as shown below:

![Importing into Softaculous](https://www.classicpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/step-2-soft.jpg)

On the tab From this Server fill in the required information (http/https and the folder) and click the Import button at the bottom of the page:

![Fill in the required information](https://www.classicpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/step-2-2-soft.jpg)

After a short while, you should see this page

![ClassicPress has been imported](https://www.classicpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/step-3-soft.jpg)

which means you successfully imported your install as ClassicPress in Softaculous!
